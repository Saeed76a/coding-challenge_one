### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# coding-challenge_one
This repository was created for practicing coding, and it concerns what we have learned in the ALX software engineering program.


############   coding challenge(question) that include pointer, array, string, function, in c progaramming language #####



#### follow the following steps ####

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Choose only one question from the bellow questions.
4. Add your user name to the README file with the question number you choose.
   ### add your user name ###
   - question one (1)  ==  <--add your user name here-->
   - question two (2)  ==  <--add your user name here-->
   - question three (3)  ==  <--add your user name here-->
   - question four (4)  ==  <--add your user name here-->
   - question five (5)  ==  <--add your user name here-->
        example :  question one (1) == yadi09  <--this is just for example-->
6. Complete your question on your local computer and push it to the repository.





1, Challenge: Count Vowels

   Write a C function countVowels that accepts a string as an argument and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U) present in the string.
   and also create your test main file 
  
   # Prototype: int countVowels( char* str);
   # Example:  -Input: "Hello, World!"
             -Output: 3





2, Challenge: Remove Duplicates from Array

   Write a C function removeDuplicates that accepts an array of integers and its size as arguments.
   The function should modify the original array by removing any duplicate elements and return the new size of the 
   array without duplicates.
   and also create your test main file and push it to repo

 Prototype: int removeDuplicates(int* arr, int size);
 Example:   -int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5};
            -int size = 7;
            -int newSize = removeDuplicates(arr, size);
            -// arr should be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            -// newSize should be 5




3, Challenge: Remove Spaces from String

   Write a C function removeSpaces that accepts a string as an argument and removes all the spaces from it. The function should modify the original string in-place using pointers.
   and also create your test main file and push it to repo
  
 Prototype: void removeSpaces(char* str);
 Example:    -char str[] = "Hello, World! How are you?";
             -removeSpaces(str);
             -// str should be "Hello,World!Howareyou?"




 4, Challenge: Remove Duplicates from String

   Write a C function removeDuplicates that accepts a string as an argument and removes any duplicate characters from it. The function should modify the original string in-place using pointers.
   and also create your test main file and push it to repo
  
 Prototype: void removeDuplicates(char* str);
 Example:    -char str[] = "Hello, World!";
             -removeDuplicates(str);
             -// str should be "Helo, Wrd!"





5, Challenge: Array Rotation

   Write a C function rotateArray that accepts an array of integers and its size, along with a rotation count.
   The function should rotate the elements of the array to the right by the given rotation count in-place using pointers.
   and also create your test main file and push it to repo
  
 Prototype: void rotateArray(int* arr, int size, int rotationCount);
 Example:    -int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
             -int size = 5;
             -int rotationCount = 2;
             -rotateArray(arr, size, rotationCount);
             -// arr should be {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}
